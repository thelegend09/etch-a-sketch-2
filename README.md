## What I learned
- In Javascript, if you want to get (letâ€™s say) the color of an item by using the property of a variable you obtained with document.querySelector, you will only get the inline style, not the CSS.
```css
p {color: blue;}
```
```javascript
const textColor = document.querySelector("p");
console.log(textColor.style.color); 
// Expected result "blue" or the HEX or RGB equivalent. 
// Actual result = ""
```
You actually have to get the computed style:
```javascript
const textColor = document.querySelector("p");
let realColor = window.getComputedStyle(textColor);
console.log(realColor.getPropertyValue("color"));
// Result = "rgb(0, 0, 255)"
```
- I learned how to toggle classes (for the modifier keys)
